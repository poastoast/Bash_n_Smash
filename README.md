Oi! I made some motor splish splash guards for Boardnamic gear drives, which also double as protectors for whenever you bottom out ;) 
There's two versions, one regular and one "extra protection" that covers the whole side of the gd facing the ground [not out yet]

ignore the version numbers in the file name, just check the branches for the most recent releases

to install, take the front, back, and bottom screw off, put the guard on the front and slide the back part, coming in from the botom, and put the screws back on to secure!
[photos will be added at some point to help understand]
