Oi! I made some motor splish splash guards for Boardnamic gear drives, which also double as protectors for whenever you bottom out ;) 
There's two versions, one regular and one "extra protection" that covers the whole side of the gd facing the ground [not out yet]

ignore the version numbers in the file name, just check the branches for the most recent releases

to install, the forward, bottom, and rear screws (as when looking at the board wheels down) need to be removed, hook the front end first, and slide the back on. The front and rear screws need 15mm length screws to compensate the thickness of the guards, but the bottom screw can stay the same when you reinstall it.

CHANGES:
  - 2.2: redsigned motor protector section for slightly more tolerance; reinforced tail section
  - 2.1: fixed model so the print doesn't have a weird bridging artifact
